    "检索增强生成（Retrieval-Augmented Generation，RAG）是一种将信息检索与生成式模型结合的混合方法。它通过引入外部知识提升语言模型的表现，从而提高准确性和事实性。\n",
    "\n",
    "在简单RAG流程中，我们遵循以下步骤：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **数据导入**：加载并预处理文本数据。\n",
    "2. **分块**：将数据拆分为更小的片段，以提升检索效果。\n",
    "3. **嵌入生成**：使用嵌入模型将文本片段转换为数值表示。\n",
    "4. **语义检索**：根据用户查询检索相关片段。\n",
    "5. **响应生成**：基于检索到的文本，使用语言模型生成回答。\n",
